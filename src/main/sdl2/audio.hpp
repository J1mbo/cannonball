/***************************************************************************
    SDL Audio Code.
    
    This is the SDL specific audio code.
    If porting to a non-SDL platform, you would need to replace this class.
    
    It takes the output from the PCM and YM chips, mixes them and then
    outputs appropriately.
    
    In order to achieve seamless audio, when audio is enabled the framerate
    is adjusted to essentially sync the video to the audio output.
    
    This is based upon code from the Atari800 emulator project.
